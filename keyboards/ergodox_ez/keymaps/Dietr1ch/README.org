* Dietr1ch's ErgoDox EZ Configuration
This is my own config. I keep the QWERTY layout, but I use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout#Programmer_Dvorak][Programmer Dvorak]] layout via Software.

** Files
[[./config.h]]
[[./keymap.c]]

** Changelog
*** 2026
**** Feb
- Updated environment and keyboard layout
*** 2016
**** Dec
- Added LED keys
- Refreshed layout graphic, comes from http://configure.ergodox-ez.com now.
**** Sep
- Created a new key in layer 1 (bottom-corner key) that resets the EEPROM.
**** Feb (V1.1)
- Made the right-hand quote key double as Cmd/Win on hold. So you get ' when you tap it, " when you tap it with Shift, and Cmd or Win when you hold it. You can then use it as a modifier, or just press and hold it for a moment (and then let go) to send a single Cmd or Win keystroke (handy for opening the Start menu on Windows).

This is what we ship with out of the factory. :) The image says it all:
